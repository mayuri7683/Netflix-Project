Performed end-to-end data cleaning and exploratory analysis on 8,000+ Netflix titles to identify trends across movies and TV shows. Processed raw data by handling missing values, splitting multi-value fields (cast, genre, director, country), and converting date-time features for deeper insights. Analyzed content distribution by type, country, genre, rating category (Kids/Teens/Adults), and release trends across years, months, and weekdays. Created visualizations using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to uncover patterns in Netflix’s global content library and user-oriented content classifications.
